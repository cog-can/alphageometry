==========================
 * From theorem premises:
K A B D L : Points
B,D,K are collinear [00]
A,L,D are collinear [01]
LK ∥ AB [02]

 * Auxiliary Constructions:
: Points


 * Proof steps:
001. A,L,D are collinear [01] & B,D,K are collinear [00] ⇒  ∠LDK = ∠ADB [03]
002. D,A,L are collinear [01] & AB ∥ KL [02] ⇒  ∠DLK = ∠DAB [04]
003. ∠LDK = ∠ADB [03] & ∠DLK = ∠DAB [04] (Similar Triangles)⇒  ΔDLK is similar to ΔDAB
