==========================
 * From theorem premises:
E F D A C B : Points
F,D,E are collinear [00]
F,A,C are collinear [01]
B,A,E are collinear [02]
BC ∥ DF [03]

 * Auxiliary Constructions:
: Points


 * Proof steps:
001. B,A,E are collinear [02] & F,A,C are collinear [01] ⇒  ∠FAE = ∠CAB [04]
002. F,D,E are collinear [00] & F,A,C are collinear [01] & BC ∥ DF [03] ⇒  ∠AFE = ∠ACB [05]
003. ∠FAE = ∠CAB [04] & ∠AFE = ∠ACB [05] (Similar Triangles)⇒  ΔAFE is similar to ΔACB
